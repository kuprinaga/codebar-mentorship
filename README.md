# codebar-mentorship
codebar Helsinki is looking into a mentorship program for people who'd like to change careers and join tech industry. Do you think something is missing from the program?  Just edit it!

**Challenge**: codebar members often ask questions related to tech companies overall, recruitment process, ask opinion of "what should I do/learn", "how can I utilise my existing background" and so on

**Solution**: connect people from tech industry to people who are looking for help through a structured mentorship program.

As a person trying to switch careers my questions may include:
- what skills do I need? 
- besides typical skills (programming concepts, particular language, etc), what are supplementary useful skills I can learn? (e.g. Git, devops, etc)
- how can I use my existing expertise/experience?
- how long will it take?
- what is portfolio like?
- how do I approach companies/how do I apply for jobs?
- how do I go through the interview?
 
People who are willing to help do not have to be very "high profile", the only thing that helps is drive to learn, potentially being from an underrepresented group or have switched careers.

**Have a program that lasts 6 months and have 3-6 meetings** + possibility of being contacted in the meantime. 

**First meeting**:
- meet & greet
- mentor introduces themselves, tells their story
- mentee introduces themselves, tells their background
- discussion about why mentee wants to join tech, what interests them, what will get them going
- what are the obstacles they are facing (e.g., time constraints? resource constraints?)?
- how can mentor suggest something to overcome the obstacles - from personal experience/heard from friends, colleagues, etc?
- for the given situation, what are the skills that mentee should have to succeed?

**Second meeting**:
- check on the progress of mentee, have they encountered any problems? Have they progressed?
- are they still interested in joining the industry?
- what kind of connections can they start making?
- what are the supplementary skills they could learn?

**Third meeting**:
- how is the progress? What are the skills mentee acquired, what are the skills mentee should still work on?
- what are the projects that mentee could do? What would be useful for their future career and employment?
- how can they start building portfolio?
- could mentee participate in Stack overflow community? Is there some other community they could be a part of?

**Forth meeting**:
- how should they apply for jobs? (external speaker?)
- what companies could they look at in particular? Applying for a specific company is always easier, can meet people, do specific project, etc
- what practical things to keep in mind? Eg taxes, salary, practicalities
